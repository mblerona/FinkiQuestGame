#  FINKI Quest - 2D Puzzle-Adventure Game

FINKI Quest is a 2D top-down puzzle-adventure game built in Godot Engine as part of our course project. The player takes the role of a student navigating the FINKI campus, aiming to find professors and pass subject-related quizzes across multiple academic years.

---

##  Game Overview

- **Story**: You are a student at FINKI. To graduate, you must pass five subject quizzes per year, each given by a professor hidden across the map.
- **Goal**: Complete all subjects in 4 academic levels without failing more than allowed times.
- **Quizzes**: Each professor challenges the player with a subject quiz (e.g., Calculus, OOP, Web Design).
- **Bonuses**: Coffee power-ups temporarily increase your speed.
- **Minimap**: A minimap helps track the player and professors' positions.
- **Progression**: Each level increases map size, complexity, and number of professors.
- **Game Over**: If the timer runs out or you fail exams, you must restart.
